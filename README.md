# XOXO and Tic Tac Toe (with XOXO)
'XOXO' is a machine learning algorithm that learns to play Tic Tac Toe. I made it as a learning exercise, to test if I grasped the basic concepts of reinforcement learning correctly.

'Tic Tac Toe (with XOXO)' is an Android app I made to both showcase XOXO and to apply what I've learned so far about Java and programming in Android Studio.
